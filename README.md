### About this App:

reactClickyGame is a memory game app built with React, a declarative, effecient, and flexible JavaScript library for UI's.  This app is inspired by the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, located in Kansas City, Missouri.  The goal is for the user to click on all of the 16 paintings once without clicking on any of them twice.  Every time a painting is clicked, the paintings are shuffled to a new position on the screen, and a point is added to the score.  When the user clicks on the same painting twice, the score resets back to zero, and new top score appears if the user has beat his/her old top score.
